# Deep Generative Chemistry 
A repository of update in generative chemistry with deep learning. Those efforts are cast into the following categories:

1. [3D Molecular Generation](#3DGen)  
2. [Recent advances in Deep Diffusion Probabilistic Models ](#diffusion)

### 1. 3D Molecular Generation <a name='3DGen'><\a>
  [Equivariant Diffusion for Molecule Generation in 3D](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.17003.pdf)
  Emiel Hoogeboom et al (2022)
  This work introduces a diffusion model for molecule generation in 3D that is equivariant to Euclidean transformations. They generate both atom coordinates and element types. First paper introducing full molecule generation with Diffusion Models.
  
  [Geometry-Complete Diffusion for 3D Molecule Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.04313.pdf)
  Alex Morehead et al (2023)
  This work proposes GCDM, a geometry-complete diffusion model that achieves new state-of-the-art results for 3D molecule diffusion generation and optimization by leveraging the representation learning strengths offered by GNNs that perform geometry-complete message-passing.
