# Deep Generative Chemistry 
A repository of update in generative chemistry with deep learning. Those efforts are cast into the following categories:

1. [Molecular Generation in 3D](#3DGen)  
2. [Reviews](#reviews)
3. [Recent advances in Deep Diffusion Probabilistic Models ](#diffusion)

### 1. Molecular Generation in 3D <a name='3DGen'>
  [Equivariant Diffusion for Molecule Generation in 3D](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.17003.pdf) \
  Emiel Hoogeboom et al (2022) \
  This work introduces a diffusion model for molecule generation in 3D that is equivariant to Euclidean transformations. They generate both atom coordinates and element types. First paper introducing full molecule generation with Diffusion Models.
  
  [Geometry-Complete Diffusion for 3D Molecule Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.04313.pdf) \
  Alex Morehead et al (2023) \
  This work proposes GCDM, a geometry-complete diffusion model that achieves new state-of-the-art results for 3D molecule diffusion generation and optimization by leveraging the representation learning strengths offered by GNNs that perform geometry-complete message-passing. \
  
### 2. Reviews <a name='reviews'>
  [Generative Models as an Emerging Paradigm in the Chemical Sciences](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c13467)\
  Dylan M. Anstine and Olexandr Isayev \
  (2023) \
  In this paper, the authors overview and critically analyze popular generative algorithms like generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, flow, and diffusion models.
